# Multiplatform App Store Implementation Guide

## Overview

This document outlines the implementation details for building a multiplatform app store using GitHub as a backend storage system. The ecosystem consists of four main applications:

1. **Dev's App**: For developers to publish their apps
2. **User's App (Mobile)**: For end-users to discover and download apps on mobile devices
3. **User's App (Desktop - Windows)**: Desktop client for Windows users
4. **User's App (Desktop - Linux)**: Desktop client for Linux users

All applications interact with a central GitHub repository that serves as the storage infrastructure for the entire platform.

## GitHub Repository Structure

### Main Repository

- Name: `multiplatform-app-store` (or similar descriptive name)
- Visibility: Public
- Description: Clear explanation of the purpose and how developers can contribute

### Repository Management Strategy

Use **Git Submodules** to link individual developer repositories:
- Each developer maintains their own repository with their apps
- The main repository contains references to these repositories as submodules
- Developers have complete control over their own repositories
- The main repository only stores references to specific commits in the developer repositories

## Dev's App Implementation

### Authentication

1. **GitHub OAuth Implementation**:
   - Register the app on GitHub as an OAuth application
   - Implement authorization code flow with PKCE for security
   - Request appropriate scopes (`repo` for repository access)
   - Store access tokens securely (use secure storage on device)

2. **User Registration Process**:
   - After OAuth authentication, collect additional information if needed
   - Generate a unique developer ID to be used in the submodule path
   - Create developer profile in app's database (if using one)

### Repository Management

1. **First-time Setup**:
   - Create a new GitHub repository for the developer (if they don't link an existing one)
   - Add this repository as a submodule to the main app store repository
   - Set up the basic directory structure for the developer

2. **App Publishing Workflow**:
   - Developer fills app metadata (name, description, version, etc.)
   - Developer uploads app binaries or provides links to files
   - App handles Git operations behind the scenes:
     - For large files: Implement Git LFS
     - For metadata: Create/update JSON files
     - Commit changes to developer's repository
     - Update submodule reference in main repository

3. **Version and Channel Management**:
   - Support branches for different channels (stable, beta)
   - Use tags for versioning
   - Create GitHub releases for each version

4. **Multi-Platform Package Management**:

## Conclusion

Building a multiplatform app store with GitHub as a backend is feasible but comes with specific challenges. This implementation guide provides a comprehensive approach to address these challenges while leveraging GitHub's strengths in version control and developer familiarity.

The key to success will be balancing simplicity for developers and users while implementing robust security measures and planning for scale from the beginning. By abstracting the complexity of Git operations in the Dev's app, you can provide a seamless experience for developers while maintaining the powerful versioning capabilities of GitHub underneath.

The implementation of desktop clients for Windows and Linux, combined with automatic system detection and package format selection, creates a truly cross-platform ecosystem that serves users regardless of their device preferences. The advanced installation features further enhance the user experience by reducing friction between discovery and usage.

As the platform grows, be prepared to evolve the architecture to potentially incorporate additional storage solutions alongside GitHub to address limitations in bandwidth, storage costs, or performance. The modular approach outlined in this guide ensures that components can be upgraded or replaced independently as requirements change and the user base expands.
