## In Plain Language:
This is essentially an MIT license with an additional requirement. While the MIT license is very permissive, we require you to get permission from the SKYIOUS organization or an administrator before using this code commercially or distributing it. We want to know who's using our software and how it's being used.

If you just want to look at the code, learn from it, or use it for personal non-commercial projects, you don't need to ask permission - go ahead! But include this license when you do.
